### Features of this system: 

- Login & Registration form fully validated by Regex. 
- Admin and Multiple users login system through the login page.
- The default email and password are set for login as admin. For admin login `Email`: `admin.employeems@gmail.com` `Password`: `@dm21InEMS#`
- Database MySQL has been used.
- Users will go to their user panel after users login and they will see the data that they provided when they registered.
- After login as an Admin, they will go to the admin dashboard and the admin will be able to update, delete and view the data of those users who are registered and whose data is in the database.
